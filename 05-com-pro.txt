Communication Protocols:
========================

Definition:
Communication protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices can communicate with each other effectively by defining the format and order of messages exchanged.


Key Concepts:

Protocols:

Protocols define the rules for communication between devices.
They specify how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and acknowledged.
Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model:

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven abstraction layers.
Each layer has specific responsibilities, and protocols operate at different layers to facilitate communication.

IP addressing 
=============

IP addressing is a fundamental concept in computer networking that enables devices on a network to communicate with each other. IP stands for Internet Protocol, and it provides a standardized way to assign unique addresses to devices on a network. These addresses are used for identifying and locating devices in a network, enabling the proper routing of data packets from one device to another.

There are two main versions of IP addressing in use today: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). I'll provide an overview of IPv4, as it has been widely used for many years, and IPv6 is designed to address the limitations of IPv4.

IPv4 Addressing:

IPv4 Address Format:

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical labels written in dotted-decimal format, such as 192.168.1.1.
Each of the four octets (groups of 8 bits) in the address ranges from 0 to 255, representing a total of 2^32 unique addresses.
The format consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots, and each set can have a value from 0 to 255.
Classes of IP Addresses:

IP addresses are traditionally divided into classes, denoted by the first octet, which determine the network size and the number of hosts in that network.
Classes include Class A (1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255), Class B (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255), and Class C (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255). There are also Class D (for multicast) and Class E (reserved) addresses.
Subnetting:

Subnetting allows an organization to divide a single IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks. It helps optimize the use of IP addresses and improve network efficiency.
Private and Public IP Addresses:

Certain IP address ranges are reserved for private use within internal networks (e.g., 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255). These private addresses are not routable on the public internet.
Public IP addresses are globally unique and are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to organizations for their public-facing devices.
Dynamic and Static IP Addresses:

IP addresses can be assigned dynamically (via DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or statically (manually configured). Dynamic addressing is commonly used for devices that frequently connect and disconnect from the network, while static addressing is often preferred for servers and network infrastructure.
IPv6 was introduced to address the limited number of available IPv4 addresses and provides a much larger address space, using a 128-bit address format. IPv6 adoption is gradually increasing as the internet continues to grow and more devices come online.
